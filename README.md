## My process

As my first solo project, I started by looking at the desgin in Photoshop.  I then mapped out my first iteration of the HTML and started to add my stylings in CSS.  I ran into issues with the styling and did some Googling and reviewing of previous projects to help resolve the issue.  I finalized the mobile design and then customized the tablet and desktop designs. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first solo project I have attempted since starting an online coding course through Skillcrush.  I challenged myself to do as much of the project by myself before seeking out additional resources.  I reviewed previous projects for coding ideas and ultimately did some Google searching to resolve an issue with getting my flexbox properties to center the content properly.  I learned the importance of setting up your HTML code so that you can get the most out of the flexbox properties.

I also challenged myself to make this a responsive site including tablet and desktop styles.  I used Photoshop to approximate sizing.


### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn how to organize my HTML to optimize my ability to customize a site.  I would also like to continue to learn about how best to use flexbox to make responsive sites.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-centering-using-flexbox) - This was refresher course on centering things using flexbox.
- I also used a screenshot of a hand-drawn example of the flexbox properties.
